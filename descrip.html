        </h1>
        16 April - I think I have fixed the error where a few invasions don't get updated or deleted by using a lot of promises/async junk.
        <br><br>
        14 April - This bot will now automatically leave servers which have a bot:non bot ratio greater than or equal to 9:1 (90%+ bots). After
        some viewing, this should only affect the bot farm servers this is in and not yours. If you have a special case, please let me know. I
        am doing this because I currently only have 512mb ram to spare.

          About:
        </h1>
        This bot automatically posts messages for the game Warframe. It will handle events for the platforms <code>pc, xb1, ps4</code>.
        It can also create and mention roles when an alert or invasion with a certain reward appears. It will only post alerts as they
        appear. That means when you initially set it up, there will be nothing until one occurrs. Invasions and alerts will be updated
        over time and will be deleted when they expire.
        <br><br>
        If you would like to see the bot in action or want any support, feel free to <a href="https://discord.gg/Zct6VgD">join my server</a>.

          Setup:
        </h1>
        Setup is simple. Create the channels in your server that you want messages for. The channels just have to be named a certain way:
        <code>(platform)_wf_alerts</code>. For example, if you want pc alerts, you would create the channel <code>pc_wf_alerts</code>. If you want
        xb1 alerts, you create the channel <code>xb1_wf_alerts</code>. You may have multiple channels with different names. If there are multiple channels
        with the same name, the bot will only post to one of them. The bot will automatically detect if the channel exists.
        <br><br>
        You may also setup roles for the bot to mention. There is a set of predefined rewards that the bot will handle. You can create these roles with the
        <code>notifysetup</code> command. For example, if you want to add roles for pc, you just have to do <code>,notifysetup pc</code> command. If you
        want roles for multiple platforms, pass multiple arguments like this: <code>,notifysetup pc xb1</code>.

          General Comments:
        </h1>
        Feel free to give me any suggestions. I have recently change the bot a lot and have updated the invitation permissions to reflect
        said change. If there is a large update, I may change add (updated) to the bot's nickname to inform users that there has been
        an update. Thank you for using my bot!
