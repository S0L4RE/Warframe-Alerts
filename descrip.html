            This bot automatically posts messages for the game Warframe. It will handle events for the <code>pc</code>, <code>xb1</code>, and <code>ps4</code> versions
            of the game. It can also create and mention roles when an alert or invasion with a certain reward appears. Messages will be sent as
            events pop up throughout the game and will be deleted as the events expire. This guarantees that only active events will be displayed
            in its channels. To the right is an example of how messages are formatted. The time stamp on the bottom of the message should correspond
            to your local time.
            <br><br>
            If you are interested in testing the bot out or have any questions/suggestions before adding it to your own server, you can join my server
            I set up through the invite link below. This includes things like adding roles the bot can create, the format of the messages, or even
            just to use the bot without inviting it to your server because I have it set up on mine.
            <br><br>

            <i style="font-size:75%">
              Note that this bot will leave servers with >80% bots. This is to save memory because I can't afford a good server.
              Also if you plan on inviting it to a server with just you, consider joining the support server. Again, this is due to cheap server issues.

          Setup:
        </h1>
        <div class="columns">
          <div class="column">
            Setup is simple. Just create channels in your server that you want messages for. The channels just have to be named the following way
            <br>
            <center><code>(platform)_wf_alerts</code></center>
            For example, if you wanted pc alerts, you would create the channel <code>pc_wf_alerts</code>. If you wanted xb1 alerts, you create the
            channel <code>xb1_wf_alerts</code>. You may have multiple channels with different names. If there are multiple channels
            with the same name, the bot will only post to one of them. The bot will automatically detect if the channel exists.
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            You may also setup roles for the bot to mention. There is a set of predefined rewards that the bot will handle. You can create these roles with the
            <code>notifysetup</code> command. For example, if you want to add roles for pc, you just have to do <code>,notifysetup pc</code> command. If you
            want roles for multiple platforms, pass multiple arguments like this: <code>,notifysetup pc xb1</code>. This may take a while because I throttled the
            command to only make a role every few seconds to avoid spamming the Discord API.
